 * 78.1: Implement class BoundedCounter with the following functionality:

 * A counter has an object variable that remembers the value of the counter. The value is within the range 0..upperBound
 * In the beginning the value is 0.
 * The upper bound of the value is defined by the constructor parameter.
 * The method next increments the value of the counter. If the value would be more that the upper limit, it wraps around
 * and becomes zero.
 * The method toString returns a string representation of the counter value.
